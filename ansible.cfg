# The path to use for the ControlPath sockets. This defaults to
# "%(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r", however on some systems with
# very long hostnames or very long path names (caused by long user names or
# deeply nested home directories) this can exceed the character limit on
# file socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you
# may wish to shorten the string below.

# Example:
# control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
control_path = %(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r
